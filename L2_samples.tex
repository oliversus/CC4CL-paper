\section{L2 data - analysis and initial validation}\label{L2_data}

One up to three scenes, which should ideally be geographically overlapping for AVHRR, MODIS AQUA, AATSR. Brief discussion. Note: also shown in paper II to demonstrate information content and discuss forward/inversion models.

Validation of level 2 data:
Comparison of AVHRR, MODIS, and AATSR with independent datasets (CALIPSO, Synop stations), ideally for one scence with similar orbit overpass times.
Variables: cloud cover, cloud top pressure, cloud optical thickness.
