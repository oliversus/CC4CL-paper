\section{L2 data - analysis and initial validation}\label{L2_data}

{\color{red}In this section we firstly show and discuss the cloud properties generated by CC4CL for one example scene. A particular focus here is the consistency among the sensors AVHRR, MODIS and AATSR. For the same scene we also present and discuss the pixel-based uncertainties of the core variables CMA, CTP, COT and CER. Secondly, a qualitative assessment of the retrieved cloud properties is carried out for three scenes using CALIOP-CALIPSO as reference.
It needs to be noted that for matching the thee sensors mentioned above and CALIOP we are limited to the high-latitudes.

\subsection{CC4CL cloud properties}
\cref{fig:CTP_intercomparison,fig:COT_intercomparison,fig:CER_intercomparison} show the retrieved CTP, COT and CER for AVHRR/NOAA18, MODIS and AATSR over North America. The scene is characterized by a large variety of different clouds. Only a rather small regions is cloud free according to the CC4CL cloud mask.

When visually inspecting CC4CL output for CTP, COT, and CER (), the data retrieved from the three different sensors appear highly similar. Main spatial patterns are resolved in all products. The data show that there are more cloud free AVHRR pixels, which is related to the coarser spatial resolution compared to MODIS and AATSR. The LST difference ranges from XY to XY minutes, and thus cloud displacement between observation times is small.

CTP data are approximately normally distributed (\cref{fig:histograms,tab:retrieval_statistics}) for all three sensors. The mean value difference between AVHRR and MODIS is not significant, but is generally larger and significant when data are compared to AATSR. Both COT and CER show positive kurtosis and skewness, as values close to 0 are most frequent. Mean value differences are also not significant between MODIS and AATSR for COT, and AVHRR and AATSR for CER. The standard deviation of differences between two sensors are always lowest for AVHRR minus MODIS.}

\subsection{Uncertainties}

Relative retrieval uncertainties are lowest for CTP and largest for COT (\cref{fig:uncertainties}). Median uncertainties in \% are CTP = \load{NA2_ctp_unc_median}26.7, COT = \load{NA2_cot_unc_median}6.1, CER = \load{NA2_cer_unc_median}2.0, and cloud mask = \load{NA2_cmask_unc_median}13.7. For CTP, \load{NA2_ctp_unc_lt10}10.0 \% of pixels have an uncertainty of $<$ 10 \%. COT uncertainties increase with COT, and a visual inspection of the RGB image (\cref{fig:RGB_07222058}) suggests that largest uncertainties are found in cases of opaque cloud coverage and probably cloud over sea-ice surfaces. CER results are similar to COT, although uncertainties are generally lower. Cloud free areas appear to show increased cloud mask uncertainties, and in particular over sea-ice surface areas. Note that the cloud mask uncertainties have been quantified as a function of the normalized difference to the cloud mask threshold, whereas for CTP, COT, and CER relative retrieval uncertainties (100 $\times$ uncertainty $\div$ retrieved value) are shown. 

\subsection{CC4CL data intercomparison}

When visually inspecting CC4CL output for CTP, COT, and CER (\cref{fig:CTP_intercomparison,fig:COT_intercomparison,fig:CER_intercomparison}), the data retrieved from the three different sensors appear highly similar. Main spatial patterns are resolved in all products. The data show that there are more cloud free AVHRR pixels, which is related to the coarser spatial resolution compared to MODIS and AATSR. The LST difference ranges from XY to XY minutes, and thus cloud displacement between observation times is small.

CTP data are approximately normally distributed (\cref{fig:histograms,tab:retrieval_statistics}) for all three sensors. The mean value difference between AVHRR and MODIS is not significant, but is generally larger and significant when data are compared to AATSR. Both COT and CER show positive kurtosis and skewness, as values close to 0 are most frequent. Mean value differences are also not significant between MODIS and AATSR for COT, and AVHRR and AATSR for CER. The standard deviation of differences between two sensors are always lowest for AVHRR minus MODIS.

\subsection{Initial validation with Calipso}

\subsubsection{Methodology and data (Ich finde das gehört in das gehört in die ``Data and Methods'' section.)}\label{sec:calipso_method}

We resampled CC4CL L2 data to a regular latitude/longitude grid at 0.1\textdegree\ $\times$ 0.1\textdegree\ resolution (better 0.05?). This resampling is required for a intercomparison of CC4CL L2 data on a common grid, as differences in sensor spatial resolution are reduced when averaging all values available for each grid box. Calipso's Level 2 5 km Cloud Layer data were produced by averaging over $\approx$14 samples beams with 70 m diameter taken every 335 m within a 5 km along-track corridor. Thus, Calipso data have a 70 m across-track $\times$ 5 km along-track spatial resolution, and the size of corresponding CC4CL grid box is approximately 11 km meridionally $\times$ 2.9 to 5.6 km zonally. As a consequence, the CC4CL grid boxes are larger than the reference Calipso pixels, but are still small enough to resolve some of the cloud features that Calipso observes. Note that AVHRR GAC data were produced by averaging 5 neighbouring pixels across-track, but Calipso data were averaged along-track.
 
We found collocations between Calipso, AVHRR, MODIS, and AATSR for three study areas for 07/22/2008 19.15 LST (study area North America 1 = NA1), 07/22/2008 20:58 LST (NA2), and 07/27/2008 08.10 LST (Siberia = SIB). These are located within 60\textdegree\ to 75\textdegree\ N latitude, and contain vegetated land, snow-covered land, open ocean, and sea-ice cover surfaces (\cref{fig:RGB_07221915,fig:RGB_07222058,fig:RGB_07270810}). The Calipso track cuts through the three study areas at an angle, so that about 130 collocated Calipso measurements are available per site. For NA1 and SIB, all Calipso pixels were classified as cloud covered, but for NA2, about half of the pixels are cloud free.

\subsubsection{Validation results}

{\color{red}

For the introduction: In this manuscript we will present…. We present a comprehensive and detailed analysis of the retrievals results collocated with CALIOP observations for three selected scenes / study areas….

Three case have been selected for detailed … Each case is subdivided into characteristic cloud fields (named sectors hereafter), which are indicated by vertical lines??? in the corresponding figure.
For selecting the 3 cases we were restricted to higher latitude, due to the orbital characteristics and trying to find a match in space and time. Land/sea balanced.

For each scene we present an rgb image, made from MODIS, together with lines indicating both (1) the swaths of the passive imager sensors AVHRR, MODIS and AATSR and (2) the position of the CALIOP curtain measured.
Then we show a vertical cross section along the CALIPSO track with a horizontal resolution of the 5 km CALIOP product. Cloud layer (uppermost three) are shown? Coloured according to vertical integrated optical thickness between their base and TOA. Coloured dots are the CC4CL retrievals. Surface type and altitude are also indicated. At the bottom, for each CALIOP product pixel (5km) we show the CALIOP cloud mask, cloud phase and cloud type for the uppermost cloud layer and at level below the uppermost cloud top for this the vertically integrated optical depth reaches 0.15 and 1.0 respectively. For the same pixels the CC4CL cloud mask, cloud phase and cloud type are also given for AVHRR, MODIS and AATSR. The phase is interpolated and cloud types are given by the most frequent value.

\vspace{5mm}\underline{\textit{Case 1}}\vspace{2mm}

For this scene we defined 4 sectors. In sector 1, a continuous, high cloud field with CTP around 300hPa is found in CALIOP. This cloud layer consists of ice and is optically thin, i.e. the COT does not exceed 1, with a tendency of getting optically thinner towards the end of the sector. For some pixels a second cloud layer is found with CTP around 580 hPa, also mainly being ice. In addition some thin clouds are scattered a bit higher than the second cloud layer or (towards the end of the sector) in the lower troposphere. The latter being water clouds. In sector 2, the uppermost clouds are geometrically even thinner, with COT also not exceeding 1. In the last third of this sector, some optically thicker low-level clouds are present. Sector 3, similar to sector 1 shows an optically thin high cloud layer and a second layer 150hPa below in which a total optical depth of 1 is exceeded. At the end of sector 3 the uppermost layer gets optically even thinner, while the second cloud layer at around 450hPa disappears and a new second layer in the lower troposphere is present. Sector 4 is mainly characterized by single cloud layers, of optical thickness larger than 1, at 800hPa and 600hPa, respectively. 

The CC4CL cloud detection identifies nearly all cloudy pixels for all three sensors. Only the end of sector 3 (all three sensors) and in sector 4 (only AVHRR) some few cloudy pixels are missed. Except in sector 2, the CC4CL CTP retrievals are mostly very consistent among the three sensors. However, the clouds are generally retrieved too low compared to the uppermost cloud layer top in CALIOP, if the uppermost layer is optically thin. In these conditions, the cloud top is usually placed between the optically thin top layer and the underlying layer with a tendency towards the lower layer. If no second cloud layer is present, the CTP is put close to the surface (e.g. in sector 2). In sector 3 the uppermost cloud layer is very thin, often below 0.15 COT), while together the second layer the COT reaches COT>1, leading to placing the CTP nearly directly at the vertical location of the second layer for all sensors.
In contrast to sectors 1-3, in sector 4 the CC4CL CTP is in very good agreement with the location of the top of the uppermost CALIOP cloud layer. These layer are optically thicker (COT>1) and are not overlaid by thinner layers, supporting a very accurate CTP retrieval with CC4CL applied to the passive sensors.
The agreement of the CC4CL phase with CALIOP is good in sector 1 until the presents of a very thin, high single layer cloud, where CC4CL switches to water phase while CALIOP has ice. The phase in sector 2 is very variable but some agreement of CC4CL to CALIOP can be found. The uppermost cloud layer is ice in CALIOP, to which the CC4CL phases mostly agree. Towards the second layer CALIOP gives liquid, while CC4CL mainly remains at the ice phase, however, with some liquid pixels inclusions. In sector 4 all clouds are liquid in CALIOP. CC4CL gives ice clouds for the second part of that sector, when the cloud top is near 600hPa. CTT retrievals show….K?! Generally speaking, the retrieved cloud phases among the passive sensors agree well.

\vspace{5mm}\underline{\textit{Case 2}}\vspace{2mm}

Case 2 is located again over North America. First half (sector 1) of this case is mainly cloud free except some high, optically very thin clouds at 300hPa in the beginning. Sectors 2 and 3 contain mainly broken cloud fields that actually do show a lot of along-track variability. Clouds are vertically located around 600hPa in sector 2 and higher (400-500hPa) in sector 3.

Except from some scattered clouds in AATSR and MODIS, the CC4CL sensors generally reflect the clear-sky situations in sector 1. The high, very thin cloud layer at the beginning is missed. The obviously wrongly identified clouds in this sector are mostly low-level according to the CTP retrieval. In sector 2 all clouds are correctly identified, however, some small gaps seen in the CALIOP data are not identified by the CC4CL at all sensors. Only the AVHRR product does reflect them to some extend. The horizontal inhomogeneity in also found for all three passive sensors in terms of small-scale variabilities of cloud phase. Generally speaking, CC4CL gives too often liquid phase in sector 2. The CC4CL CTP retrievals are very variable, as in CALIOP, with an underestimation of the cloud height of approx. 100hPa on average. The horizontal inhomogeneity in the cloud fields in sector 3 is similar to sector 2. The CC4CL results are similarly inhomogeneous. Even though most clouds are correctly identified by CC4CL in sector 3, the retrievals of phase and cloud top pressure are significantly deviating from CALIOP. The cloud top pressure difference between CALIOP and CC4CL partly amount to 500hPa.

\vspace{5mm}\underline{\textit{Case 3}}\vspace{2mm}

Case 3 is located north of Siberia mainly covering the Kara and Barents Sea and crossing the Novaya Zemlya islands. For this case we have defined 3 sectors. The first one containing a vertically and horizontally somewhat inhomogeneous cloud field located between 400 and 700 hPa. This layer is overlaid by very thin (COD lt 0.15) high-level cloud layers at the beginning and end of the sector, which are located around 250hPa. Sector 2 is dominated by a geometrically very thick, but optically very thin cloud layer with COT below 1, partly even below 0.15. The top of this layer is located around 250hPa and it has a geometrical thickness of about 220hPa. Underneath this layer some low-level and some mid-level clouds are found being strati-form organised. Sector 3 is very different, containing strati-form, single-layer cloud fields at 700hPa (first part of sector) and at 800hPa (second part of sector). These cloud fields have optical thicknesses larger than 1.

The CC4CL cloud detection identifies all clouds correctly in case 3. In sector 1, CC4CL places the cloud tops around 550hPa, which is often close to the CALIOP result when neglecting the very thin, very high cloud layer in the first part of this sector. However, also some and optically thinner cloud layers near the mid-level cloud layer are missed. At the end of sector 1, CC4CL places some clouds further down in the troposphere, while there is some scatter between the passive sensors; in contrast to the consistent CC4CL CTP retrievals in the first part of the sector. In sector 2, the CC4CL CTP is roughly around 600hPa, which is on the one hand in significant contrast to the geometrical height of the uppermost CALIOP clod layer (located around 220hPa), but on the other hand explainable since the upper cloud layer is optically thin. The measure signal seems again to be a mixture from that very high level, optically thin cloud layer and lower (partly optically thicker) layers of clouds or the surface. The CC4CL phase shows some disagreement with CALIOP in the first part of the sector, showing liquid clouds (CALIOP has ice), which turns into a better agreement in the second part of the sector (now both have ice), once another cloud layer is underneath the first and not the surface. In section 3 the agreement between CC4CL and CALIOP is remarkable, in the first and second part of the sector. CC4CL cloud top pressure are nearly exactly located at the top of the uppermost CALIOP cloud layer. An exception is here a slight overestimation of the CTH at the beginning of the sector under the presence of the optically very thin, high cloud layer. However, phase of CC4CL is in disagreement with CALIOP in the second part of the sector, when the clouds are higher, in which CC4CL determines ice and CALIOP liquid clouds.

\vspace{5mm}\underline{\textit{Validation summary}}\vspace{2mm}

}


The three study areas show that CC4CL retrievals of CTP are very close to Calipso values for single layer, optically thick clouds. The mean CTP bias (CC4CL minus Calipso) is just \load{NA1_ctp_bias_part}26.0 hPa for NA1 and pixels at $>$ 73.7\textdegree\ N, and \load{SIB_ctp_bias_part}20.3 hPa for SIB at $>$ 74\textdegree\ N. In case of multi-layer clouds, CC4CL estimates are often located in between Calipso's top and bottom layer estimates, and rarely even below the lowest layer. For these cases, the optimal estimation algorithm processes satellite signals that are likely to contain radiance contributions from multiple cloud layers. The OE then optimizes the fit between modelled and observed radiances by placing the cloud lower in the atmospheric profile, and so the mixed nature of the satellite data leads to an overestimation of CTP. In general, underestimation of CTP is rare (\% of pixels whose CTP is CC4CL $<$ Calipso = \load{NA1_ctp_bias}10.3 (NA1), \load{NA2_ctp_bias}2.2 (NA2), and \load{SIB_ctp_bias}15.8 (SIB)).

There is no clear influence of the underlying land type or topography on retrieval values or the cloud mask. However, the limited sample size does not allow for generalizations. Only for site NA2, Calipso identified cloud-free pixels, \load{cfree_cc4cl_and_calipso_NA2}79.2\% of which were also detected as cloud-free by CC4CL's neural network cloud mask, and with few exceptions as low level water clouds otherwise. In few cases, CC4CL fails to detect clouds seen by Calipso (\% of missed clouds = \load{cfree_calipso_cloudy_CC4CL_NA1}8.9 (NA1), \load{cfree_calipso_cloudy_CC4CL_NA2}21.3 (NA2), \load{cfree_calipso_cloudy_CC4CL_SIB}0.6 (SIB)). We did not account for fractional cloud coverage, as we set a grid box as cloud covered if any corresponding CC4CL pixel contains cloud information. As a consequence, there are slightly more cloud covered pixels for the spatially higher resolved MODIS and AATSR data than AVHRR.

There is no Calipso cloud layer for which the comparison with CC4CL phase clearly agrees best. After having rounded CC4CL values to the nearest integer, the percentage of pixels with equal phase is lowest for the top layer at COD $>$ 0 (NA1 = \load{phase_match_calipso_CC4CL_NA1_layer0}49.4 \%, NA2 = \load{phase_match_calipso_CC4CL_NA2_layer0}32.2 \%, SIB = \load{phase_match_calipso_CC4CL_SIB_layer0}62.6 \%), but similar for the mid layer COD $>$ 0.15 (NA1 = \load{phase_match_calipso_CC4CL_NA1_layer1}52.6 \%, NA2 = \load{phase_match_calipso_CC4CL_NA2_layer1}46.5 \%, SIB = \load{phase_match_calipso_CC4CL_SIB_layer1}66.7 \%), and the bottom layer COD $>$ 1 (NA1 = \load{phase_match_calipso_CC4CL_NA1_layer2}46.7 \%, NA2 = \load{phase_match_calipso_CC4CL_NA2_layer2}57.4 \%, SIB = \load{phase_match_calipso_CC4CL_SIB_layer2}66.7 \%). When averaged over all layers, phase agreement is largest for site SIB (\load{phase_match_calipso_CC4CL_SIB_layermean}65.3 \%), and clearly lower for NA1 (\load{phase_match_calipso_CC4CL_NA1_layermean}49.6 \%) and NA2 (\load{phase_match_calipso_CC4CL_NA2_layermean}45.4 \%).

For ice clouds, the most frequently occuring cloud types are cirrus (ID=6) for Calipso and overlap (ID=8) or cirrus (ID=7) for CC4CL. Water cloud types are more heterogeneous and for Calipso predominantly low transparent (ID=0), but altostratus (ID=5) and altocumulus (ID=4) are also frequent. CC4CL water clouds are approximately equally distributed amongst water (ID=3) and supercooled (ID=4) cloud types. Statistics: percentages for most frequent cloud types. Also: Which cloud type is dominant if CC4CL phase is different to Calipso phase?
